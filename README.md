- **Contextual Answers**: The search engine not only retrieves relevant documents but also provides detailed answers to your questions, drawing from the content of the documents.
- **Streamlit Interface**: The application is built using the Streamlit framework, providing a user-friendly and interactive web-based interface for easy access and usage.
